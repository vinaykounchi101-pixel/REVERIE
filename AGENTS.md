## Additional Project Rules

### Code Quality
- Do not hardcode values that should come from configuration, constants, environment variables, or the Design System.
- Do not use inline styling. Use the project's styling system, reusable classes, or shared components.
- Do not duplicate constants, configuration, validation rules, or UI values unnecessarily.
- Prefer reusable components and utilities over repeated code.
- Keep functions and components focused and reasonably small.
- Do not add unnecessary dependencies.

### Architecture
- Follow the existing project architecture and folder structure.
- Keep API routes/controllers thin. Business logic belongs in services.
- Database access belongs in repositories.
- Do not bypass the defined architecture without a clear reason.
- Keep frontend API communication inside the defined API/service layer.

### Database
- Use PostgreSQL as defined by the SRS.
- Use Alembic for all schema changes.
- Do not modify the database schema manually.
- Do not use floating-point arithmetic for monetary values.
- Seed only the data explicitly defined as required by the SRS.
- Seed data must be handled through migrations and must be safe to run without creating duplicates.
- Do not add fake, demo, or placeholder financial data unless explicitly requested.

### Validation & API
- Validate important data on both frontend and backend.
- Backend validation is authoritative.
- Follow the API contracts, status codes, and error format defined in the SRS.
- Do not invent undocumented endpoints, parameters, or response formats.
- Do not silently change existing API behavior.

### UI/UX
- Follow the Design System for colors, typography, spacing, components, responsive behavior, and other visual decisions.
- Do not create one-off styles when an existing Design System value or component can be reused.
- Do not use inline styles.
- Keep UI consistent across all screens.
- Implement loading, empty, validation-error, and system-error states where required.
- Make the application responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Use animations and micro-interactions only when they improve usability or feedback.
- Respect accessibility requirements and reduced-motion preferences.

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets, credentials, API keys, or database passwords.
- Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, or other files containing real secrets.
- Keep `.env.example` updated with required variables and placeholder values only.
- Do not expose internal errors, stack traces, credentials, or sensitive configuration to users.

### Testing
- Add tests for important business logic and critical user flows.
- Test validation and important edge cases, not only the happy path.
- Do not consider a feature complete when required tests are missing.

### Scope & Changes
- V1 must follow the approved PRD and SRS scope.
- Do not implement future-phase features "just in case."
- Do not introduce unnecessary complexity.
- Do not change the existing architecture, folder structure, API, database design, or project rules without a clear requirement.
- Do not remove or modify existing project rules unless explicitly instructed.
- Before making a significant change, verify it against the PRD, SRS, and Design System.
